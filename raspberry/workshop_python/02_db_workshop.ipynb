    "## SQLite\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshow we will use a [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) database and the [`sqlite3`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html) python library to store and retrieve data.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLite is a file-based *embedded database* written in C which is widely used by applications in almost every software aspect. All major web browsers, Android, iOS, Fedora, Lightroom, iTunes, BMW, ... either support SQLite or use a SQLite database internally. <sup>Sources [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLite#Notable_uses), [2](https://www.sqlite.org/mostdeployed.html)</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "- easy to setup -> just use library and start\n",
    "- serverless -> no configuration and little administration\n",
    "- single file based database -> easy to migrate\n",
    "- support by many programming languages\n",
    "- small footprint < 500kB\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "- not fully SQL-92 standard\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Quirks of SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/quirks.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"flexibly typed\" -> `INSERT INTO Table (INTEGER_COLUMN) VALUES ('1234')`  is possible\n",
    "- no boolean type -> `TRUE` and `FALSE` are represented as integers `1` and `0`, respectively  \n",
    "*Note: 'TRUE', 'FALSE' can be used in SQLite but they are just aliases to `1` and `0`*\n",
    "- no dedicated `DATETIME` type -> store as *ISO-8601* `TEXT` or as *Unix Time* `INTEGER`\n",
    "- INTEGER != TEXT -> `SELECT 1='1';` returns `FALSE`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supported SQLite Types\n",
